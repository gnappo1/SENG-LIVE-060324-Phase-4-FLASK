# FLASK

## What is Flask?
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

## Who created Flask and when?
Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004. The first version of Flask was released in 2010.

## Why Flask?
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

## Components of Flask FullStack Applications
Flask applications can be divided into two main components:
1. **Frontend**: This is the part of the application that users interact with. It is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input.
2. **Backend**: This is the part of the application that users do not interact with directly. It is responsible for processing data, performing calculations, and interacting with databases. Within the backend, there are two main components:
    - **Views**: These are the functions that handle requests from the frontend. They are responsible for processing data, performing calculations, and rendering templates.
    - **Models**: These are the classes that represent the data in the application. They are responsible for interacting with the database and performing operations on the data.
